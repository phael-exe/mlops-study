# MLOps Studies

This repository is dedicated to studies on MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). Here I will be exploring tools, concepts, and best practices related to the MLOps lifecycle.

## Projects

### 1. app_compose

This is the first project in this repository. It's a simple web application to count visits, built with a microservices architecture using Docker Compose. You can find more details in the project's own [README.md](./app_compose/README.md).
